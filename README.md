SublimeLinter-ruby
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-ruby)

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) provides an interface to linting via [ruby -wc](https://www.ruby-lang.org). It will be used with files that have the “Ruby” syntax.

## Installation
SublimeLinter must be installed in order to use this plugin. 

Please use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) to install the linter plugin.

Before installing this plugin, you must ensure that `ruby` is installed on your system. On Mac OS X and Linux, `ruby` comes preinstalled. On Windows, follow the instructions on the [Ruby site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

If you are using `rvm` or `rbenv`, ensure that they are loaded in your shell’s “profile” file. See [here](http://sublimelinter.com/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#shell-startup-files) for more information.
